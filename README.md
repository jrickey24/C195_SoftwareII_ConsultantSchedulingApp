#Description of Chosen A3f Report - "SoftwareAppointmentsByOffice.java" :
The report of choice "SoftwareAppointmentsByOffice.java" generates the percentage of appointments
scheduled of type: "Software Development" by office location: "White Plains, Phoenix, Montreal, London".
This data is presented in the form of a pie chart. This provides an element of data visualization to the application
which serves to assist with making informed business decisions regrading additional staffing requirements, and
profitable markets as the business expands. Lambdas are used to help retrieve this data.

#Directions:
The application is launched through the Main.java class. The properties files are used to assign the login screen
values to French or English based on the user's system settings. All times are presented to the user in their local
time & validations are enforced to handle time conversions between zones throughout the program.
If login is successful, the user is notified of any appointments scheduled within the next 15 minutes of authentication
in their local time & redirected to the Main/Home menu. The results of each login attempt are logged to:
"C:\Users\{UserEnvironment}\ConsultantSchedulingApp\login_activity.txt".
The main menu is divided into three sections: "Customers, Appointments, Reports". To navigate to a specific section,
the button corresponding to the chosen selection is clicked or pressed. All screens within the application will either
redirect the user to the Home/Main screen upon completed action/confirmation, or provide the user with a "Home" button
option.
